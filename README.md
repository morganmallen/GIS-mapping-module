# Overview

This GIS Map app is a software that has 20 US national parks marked on it. The map is rendered using Google Maps API, which provides the ability to drag the map to a certain place, as well as zooming in. A functionality that was added was the ability to filter the parks by state. When clicking on a marker, a the name of the park as well as a brief description appears in a popup.

The reason I write this software was to learn how to use Google Maps API so that I can use it in future projects. Many websites utilize a map feature of some kind, so I thought it would be useful to know how to it myself.

# Development Environment

The code editor I used for this project is VSCode. The language that I used was React.js. I used this framework to create different components and use them in the app. This also enabled me to use HTML, JavaScript, and a little CSS. I also used the useState hook from React.

The Map is rendered using the Google Maps API. This is what provides the map, as well as the dragging and zooming functionality. I downloaded Marker and InfoWindow components from the Google Maps API as well.
